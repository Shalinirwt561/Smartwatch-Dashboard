📊 Smartwatch Sales & Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

🔍 Project Overview
Smartwatches are widely used today, and multiple brands compete based on pricing, features, and customer satisfaction.
However, raw product data alone does not clearly show which smartwatches offer the best value or which features influence customer preference.
This project uses Power BI to transform smartwatch data into an interactive dashboard that helps analyze brand performance, pricing trends, customer ratings, and feature impact.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze smartwatch brands based on price, ratings, and features 
Identify value-for-money smartwatches
Understand the relationship between price and customer satisfaction
Highlight features that influence customer preference
Build a business-ready, interactive dashboard


🛠 Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Dashboard development
Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
DAX – KPI and measure creation
Data Visualization – Business storytelling and insights



📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains smartwatch-related information such as:
Brand name
Price
Customer ratings
Product features
Model details

🔄 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Data preparation was done using Power Query with the following steps:
Removed missing and duplicate records
Standardized price and rating formats
Converted data types for accurate analysis
Created new calculated columns:
Price Category (Low / Mid / High)
Feature Classification
Optimized the data model for performance


📌 KPIs Created
The following KPIs were designed to give quick insights:
Total number of smartwatches
Average smartwatch price
Average customer rating
Brand-wise product count
Feature-wise popularity

📊 Dashboard Visualizations
The dashboard includes:
KPI Cards for summary metrics
Bar Charts for brand comparison
Scatter Plot showing price vs rating relationship
Interactive slicers for:
Brand
Price range
Features
These visuals allow users to explore data dynamically and identify trends easily.

🔍 Key Insights
📉 Price vs Rating
Mid-range smartwatches receive higher average ratings than premium-priced models.
Higher price does not always lead to higher customer satisfaction.
🏷 Brand Performance
Some well-known brands offer many products but show lower average ratings.
Emerging brands perform well by offering better features at competitive prices.


⚙ Feature Impact

Smartwatches with Bluetooth calling, GPS, and fitness tracking are more popular.
Feature-rich models outperform basic models, even at slightly higher prices.


👥 Customer Preference

Customers prioritize features and usability over brand name.
Value-for-money smartwatches dominate customer preference trends.
